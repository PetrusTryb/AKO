## How to run
This repository contains code written in `C`, and `MASM` - Microsoft Macro Assembler.
### Labs 1-5
Easiest way to run the code is to use `Microsoft Visual Studio` with `MASM` installed. The code can be run by creating a new project and adding the files from the selected lab to the project. Select correct architecture (`x86` or `x64`) on the top of the window. Press PPM on the project name in the Solution Explorer and select `Build Dependencies` -> `Build Customizations` and check `MASM`. Then the code can be run by pressing `F5` or `Ctrl + F5`.
### Lab 6
The code can be run by using `DOSBox` or `DOSBox-X` emulator. Script for easy compilation is provided in the `lab6` folder. Navigate to the `lab6` folder and run the `build.bat` script with name of the file as an argument. For example:
```bash
build.bat snake
```
Then run the compiled file with the same name as the source file:
```bash
snake
```
### Notes
The notes are written in `Markdown` and can be viewed in any text editor or in a web browser. The notes are written in Polish.
